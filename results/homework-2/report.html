Octree construction (50 pts)
============================
**1. What information do you store per octree node?**<br>
    Octree node is defined as a cpp struct, and it has three membership variables:

        - `BoundingBox3f bbox`: the bounding box of the space that this octree node covers
        - `OctreeNode *children[8]`: the eight children of this octree node (for a leaf node, it is an array of eight NULL)
        - `TriangleList *triList`: the indexes of triangles that this leaf octree node covers (`typedef std::vector<uint32_t> TriangleList`). Please note that all interior nodes have triList being Null.
**2. How many bytes of memory does one of your octree nodes occupy?**<br>
    I monitored the memory usage of the nori process at the point when the actual rendering just started by appending a infinite loop at the end of build().

        * When `build()` is an empty function, i.e. no octree is built, the memory usage of the entire nori process is 24.1MB.
        * After implementing the octree construction, the memory usage of the entire nori process is 110.7MB.
        * If we assume all the extra memory usage is due to the implementation of the octree, my octree occupies 86.6MB of memory.
    I also explicitly calculated the memory usage by using the `sizeof` function

        - The total size of the octree is 84.85MB, 127.56 bytes per node on average
        - The result is similar to the one given by system monitor.

**3. Statistics for the Ajax scene:**<br>
    The statistics are collected under the following conditions:
        - No TBB, No sorted traversal
        - Leaf node threshold = 10
        - max depth = 8
        - early stop = 3
        - image = 768*768, spp = 32
    Construction time: 516.0ms
    Number of interior nodes: 83157
    Number of leaf nodes: 582100
    Average number of triangles per leaf node: 4.9302

**4. Design details**<br>

    - within `build()`, another function `buildSubtree()` is called to recursively build the entire octree, which returns the pointer to the root node
    - There are three termination conditions for recursive tree building:
        - there are not more than 10 triangles within current node
        - the number of triangles between the parent node and child node is not reduced for too many times, trigger the early stop condition
        - the depth has reached the max_depth limit


Ray traversal (25 pts)
======================
**1. How long did it take to render the scene on your machine?**<br>
    8.3 second.

**2. How much of a speed-up did you achieve over what was there before?**<br>
    To create a simplified rendering task, I reduced the resolution from 768*768 to 256*256, and reduced spp from 32 to 1 to accommodate the brute force method.

        - Brute force method: 150s
        - Octree acceleration: 83.0ms
        - Then for the simplified rendering task, the speed-up is 1807x

    We can extrapolate to obtain an estimate of the time required by the brute force algorithm for the original rendering task,

        - Brute force method: 150 * 32 * 3 * 3 = 43200s
        - Octree acceleration: 8.3s
        - Then for the original rendering task, the speed-up is 5205x

**3. Design details**<br>

    - For function `rayIntersect()`, it can choose between using the brute force method or using octree acceleration
    - When using octree acceleration, it invokes the function `rayIntersectOctree()` to find the nearest intersection using the octree
    - As the children nodes are not sorted, need to traverse all the children even if an intersection is already found
    - After finding the nearest intersection, the following procedures are the same as before


Improved ray traversal (25 pts)
===============================
**1. Include the surface normal visualization of the Ajax bust rendered by both your basic and improved implementations. They should match perfectly.**<br>
    Below is a comparison between the unsorted traversal and sorted traversal.

    <img src="ajax-normals.png" alt="Non-improved">
</div>

**2. How long did it take to render the scene on your machine with this improved version?**<br>
    2.6s.

**3. How much of a speedup is this relative to Part 2?**<br>
    Compared with the implementation of part 2, the speed-up is 8.3 / 2.6 = 3.19x

**4. Design details**<br>

    - The sort method which keeps tracking the indexes takes reference to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1577475/c-sorting-and-keeping-track-of-indexes
    - Having sorted the children nodes, recursively check all children of an interior node from the closest to the furthest
    - Traversal is terminated once an intersection is found, which is guaranteed to be the nearest one

Hacker Points: Thread Building Blocks (TBB) Acceleration (25 pts)
===============================
- I find there are two places in the octree building that may applicable for TBB acceleration:
    - when traversing all the triangles of the current node to designate each triangle to some children nodes
    - when recursively building the octree for the eight children.
    Intuitively, I think the second scenario is more suitable for TBB acceleration, as the gain of using TBB for triangle traversal may not compensate the additional overhead.

- I implemented TBB in both positions, and tested the performance gain.
    - for the first scenario, the construction time decreased from 516ms -> 513ms, almost no speedup
    - for the second scenario, the construction time decreased from 516ms -> 127ms, 4.06x speedup

Apparently, the second scenario is more suitable for TBB, which is consistent with what I expected.
Thus, by default, I enable TBB for recursively tree building, and disable TBB for triangle traversal.
Please also note that, to accommodate parallel tree building, the variables used to collect statistic data are replaced by their atomic or concurrent version.


This is the end of my report. Thank you!
================================================



Note: Nori automatically generates both an `.exr` as well as an sRGB tonemapped `.png` image of your rendering that is
directly used for the comparison above. Please still commit both versions in your `results/homework-X` folder.

Feedback
========

We would appreciate any comments or criticism to improve the projects in future years--naturally, this part will not be
graded. Examples of information that is useful to us includes:

* How much time did you spend on the assignment? How was it divided between designing, coding, and testing?
* What advice should we have given you before you started?
* What was hard or surprising about the assignment?
* What did you like or dislike? What else would you change?
