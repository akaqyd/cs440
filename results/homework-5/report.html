        - Return `li` which is the accumulated contribution from all the emitters along the path

    ~~~cpp
        Color3f li(0.f), throughput(1.f);

Path tracer with next event estimation (25 points)
==================================================

- `Color3f Li(const Scene *scene, Sampler *sampler, const Ray3f &ray)`
    - The implementation of path tracer with next event estimation is similar to the previous brute force one with the following differences
    - When an emitter is found along on the path, its emitted radiance is considered only if the previous bounce is specular
    - For each intersection found along the path, the direct illumination it received from emitters is included in `li`
    - Such direct illumination is computed in the same way as previous assignment, where an emitter is uniformly sampled from the scene, and a point on the associated mesh is sampled uniformly over its surface area

    ~~~cpp
        // Calculate the L_e contribution of current intersection point if it is an emitter
        Vector3f wo = (prev_p - its.p).normalized();
        if (its.mesh->isEmitter() && specular_bounce) 
            li += throughput * its.mesh->getEmitter()->le(its.p, its.shFrame.n, wo);

        // Calculate the L_d contribution of current intersection (direct illumination)
        li += throughput * Ld(scene, sampler, its, wo);

Path tracer with Multiple Importance Sampling (30 points)
=========================================================
- `Color3f Li(const Scene *scene, Sampler *sampler, const Ray3f &ray)`
    - The implementation of path tracer with Multiple Importance Sampling is based on path tracer with next event estimation.
    - The main difference is that the calculation of the direct illumination is divided into two parts
        - Emitter sampling with MIS
            - Similar to the next event estimation, but the contribution of the light source sample now is weighted by also considering the BSDF sampling probability density
        - BSDF sampling with MIS
            - If the new direction from BSDF sampling arrives on an emitter, the emitted radiance from this emitter is combined with the previous mentioned part to be the complete direct illumination term.
            - The contribution of the BSDF sample is weighted by also considering the emitter sampling probability density
        - In the computation of the balance heuristic for the above two terms, all probability densities are expressed in solid angle.
    ~~~cpp
    // compute emitter MIS weight
    float pdf_bsdf  = its.mesh->getBSDF()->pdf(bRec);         // wrt solid angle
    float pdf_light = em->pdfLi(its.p, its.shFrame.n, p, n);  // wrt solid angle
    pdf_light /= scene->getEmittersSize();                    // the probability to sample an emitter

    if (pdf_light + pdf_bsdf <= 0.f)
        return 0.f;
    else
        return bsdfVal * l_i * pdf_light / (pdf_light + pdf_bsdf);
    ~~~

    ~~~cpp
    // new direction hit an emitter, calculate the direct illumination at its via BSDF MIS
    if (next_its.mesh->isEmitter()) {
        float pdf_bsdf, pdf_light;
        pdf_bsdf  = its.mesh->getBSDF()->pdf(bRec);                                                            // wrt. solid angle
        pdf_light = next_its.mesh->getEmitter()->pdfLi(its.p, its.shFrame.n, next_its.p, next_its.shFrame.n);  // wrt solid angle
        pdf_light /= scene->getEmittersSize();                                                                 // the probability to sample an emitter

        if (pdf_light + pdf_bsdf <= 0.f)
            li += 0.f;
        else
            li += throughput * pdf_bsdf / (pdf_light + pdf_bsdf) * next_its.mesh->getEmitter()->le(next_its.p, next_its.shFrame.n, (its.p - next_its.p).normalized());

Hacker Points (20 points)
=========================================================
## Discussion of the implementation
- My implementation is basically based on the paper *Microfacet Models for Refraction through Rough Surfaces* and takes reference from the pbrt MicrofacetTransmission class.
- It is composed of two files
    - warp.cpp
    - microfacet-hacker.cpp

- warp.cpp
    - `Vector3f Warp::squareToGGX(const Point2f &sample, float alpha)`
        - The GGX sampling method
        - Implementation follows equation 35 and 36 from the paper
    - `float Warp::squareToGGXPdf(const Vector3f &m, float alpha) `
        - The GGX probability density query method
        - Implementation follows eq. 33

- microfacet-hacker.cpp
    - `Color3f eval(const BSDFQueryRecord &bRec) const`
        - This function receives a BSDF query record and computes the BRDF term and BTDF term respectively using `bRec.wi` and `bRec.wo`
        - The returned BSDF value is the sum of the BRDF term and BTDF term
        - The BRDF term is computed in the similar way as normal microfacet except that the distribution is replaced by the GGX
        - The BTDF term is computed following the paper. It first computes the halfway vector given $w_i$ and $w_o$, then computes the shadowing term $G$, Fresnel term $F$, probability density $D$, and finally returns the BTDF term computed using the above terms according to the formula.
    
    - `Color3f sample(BSDFQueryRecord &bRec, Sampler *sampler)`
        - The algorithm first samples a halfway vector $w_h$ following the GGX distribution
        - Given $w_h$ and $w_i$, it computes the Fresnel term and randomly chooses between reflection and transmission using the Fresnel term
        - For either reflection or transmission, the scattered direction $w_o$ is computed from $w_i$ and $w_h$ using reflection law or transmission law
        - The BSDF val can be computed by calling the above defined `eval()` method
        - Given $w_i$ and $w_o$, the pdf for reflection and transmission can be computed by using their respective Jacobian of the half-direction transform and weighted using the Fresnel term
        - The returned value is the BSDF value divided by the solid angle pdf and multiplied by the cosine factor
